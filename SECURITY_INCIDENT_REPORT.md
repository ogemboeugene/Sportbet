# 🚨 SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE - RESOLVED

## Incident Summary
**Date:** July 27, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Severity:** HIGH  

## What Happened
During the initial repository setup, placeholder environment files accidentally contained real API keys and sensitive credentials instead of example values. This was detected by GitHub's secret scanning and GitGuardian.

## Exposed Data
The following types of credentials were temporarily exposed:
- MongoDB Atlas connection strings
- Payment gateway API keys (Stripe, Flutterwave, PayStack, M-Pesa)
- Firebase configuration and private keys
- Third-party service API keys (Odds API, Africa's Talking, etc.)
- SMTP credentials

## Immediate Actions Taken
1. ✅ **Identified all exposed secrets** in `.env.example`, `.env.production.template`, `.env.staging.template`, and Firebase config
2. ✅ **Sanitized all files** by replacing real credentials with placeholder values
3. ✅ **Force-pushed clean commit** to overwrite compromised git history
4. ✅ **Verified repository security** - no more secret detection alerts

## Security Measures Implemented
- 🔐 All example files now contain only placeholder values
- 🔐 Comprehensive `.gitignore` prevents real environment files from being committed
- 🔐 Real credentials are stored separately and never committed to version control
- 🔐 Added security validation checks to prevent future incidents

## Recommendations for Users
1. **Rotate any production credentials** if you used similar keys
2. **Always use `.env.local`** or `.env` files (gitignored) for real credentials
3. **Never commit real API keys** - always use placeholder values in examples
4. **Enable secret scanning** on your repositories for early detection

## Prevention Measures
- Added pre-commit hooks to scan for potential secrets
- Updated documentation with security best practices
- Implemented template validation to ensure examples contain placeholders only
